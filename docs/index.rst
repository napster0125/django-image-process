ImageKit
========

ImageKit brings automated image processing to your Django models. With an API
similar to that of Django's :ref:`models.Meta <django:meta-options>` options
class and the creation of a specification file, you'll be able to create an
infinite number of renditions for any image using any number of preprocessors.
